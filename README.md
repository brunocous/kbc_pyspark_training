# Data Engineering with Pyspark

* Context: 
  
  Classroom lectures given at KBC, a financial institute in Belgium, between the dates of 2019-05-13 and 2019-05-15.

* Objectives:

  - Introduce good data engineering practices.
  - Illustrate modular and easily testable data transformation pipelines using Pyspark.
  
* Audience:

  Employees of KBC involved in writing (porting?) transformation pipelines. General knowledge level: junior - medior.
  
  Participants were asked (by KBC personel) to go through two online Python courses prior to participation.

* Approach:

  Lecturer first sets the foundations right for Python development and gradually builds up to pyspark data pipelines.
  There is a high degree of participation expected from the students: they will need to write code themselves and reason on topics, so that they can better retain the knowledge. 
  
  Course notes will be made available _after_ the day sessions. Materials needed for the exercices will be provided through Github directly.
